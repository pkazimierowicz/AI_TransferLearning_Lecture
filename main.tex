	\part{Why Transfer Learning is fun and profit?}
	\section{Introduction}
		\begin{frame}{What will be talking about?}
			Transfer learning (Inductive transfer) for Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). 
			\newline
			\newline
			Process where structure or knowledge from a learning problem is used to enhance learning on a related problem\footnote{West, Jeremy; Ventura, Dan; Warnick, Sean (2007), "A Theoretical Foundation for Inductive Transfer", \url{http://cpms.byu.edu/springresearch/abstract-entry?id=861}}. 
			\newline
			\newline
			Example: \newline
			Take an image classification model that is capable to correctly label common objects (a dog, a tree or an airplane)
			\newline 
			Retrain it to label types of yoghurt on a production lane.
		\end{frame}
	
	\section{Steps needed to be designed for image classification model:}
	\begin{frame}{First of all - why do we need Transfer Learning?}
		There is a lot of to be designed to build an image classification model:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item first layer:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item data preprocessing,
				\item feature extraction,
			\end{itemize}

		\item middle layers:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item what shall be in the middle layers
				\item btw, what kind of a network shall it be?
			\end{itemize}
		
		\item the last layer:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item actual classification and labels.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	 \end{frame}
 
 	\begin{frame}{Sounds easy, but in reality it looks something like this...}
 	\centering
	 \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/design}
	\end{frame}
 
	\begin{frame}{But there is a problem...}
		We usually don't really know what is the best solution to our specific case scenario.
		\newline
		\newline
		Usual methods consist of trial and error, blind luck, and intuition.
	
	 \end{frame}
 
 	\section{But there is a lot of well designed models}
	\begin{frame}{Big minds have done it better (probably)}
	Huge research centers and companies have the knowledge and resources to design and train good models:
		 \begin{itemize}
		 	\item they have huge amounts of data (image net is around 14 million of labeled images!)
		 	\item these models have been already trained (training on GPU can take weeks)
		 \end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Labeling the images takes time and patience...}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{images/kuba}
	\end{frame}
% it breaks here

 	\begin{frame}{Can we just take a pretrained model and use it?}
 		Of course we can, but:
		 \begin{itemize}
		 	\item it will not exactly work,
		 	\item there is difference between butterflies, airplanes and printed circuit boards.
		 \end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

\section{So, what is this tranfer learning for real?}
 	\begin{frame}{Can we train the defined model on our dataset?}
 	We can take some shortcuts:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item let's say that we have a huge amount of labeled data - that's cool,
			\item we're no researchers - we can take already designed neural network scheme,
			\item after training it on our dataset - we might expect good results.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
 
 	\begin{frame}{But what if I don't have a huge dataset?}
 		If we have a significantly smaller dataset, we could try:
 		\begin{itemize}
		 	\item take the weights from the model as it is already trained,
		 	\item retrain it from this point on our dataset,
		 	\item depending on how similar our problem is to the original one - that good results.
		 \end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

\section{But first, let's talk a bit about theory...}
  	\begin{frame}{How does transfer learning work?}
			 \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/interpr}
	 \end{frame}
  	\begin{frame}{Let's sum this up!}
		We have three approaches possible to transfer learning:
		 \begin{itemize}
		 	\item take the model as it is - and use it,
		 	\item take the model structure and train it on our (huge) dataset,
		 	\item take the model and it's weights and train it on our smaller dataset.
		 \end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
 \section{Once again - will this really work?}

		Example time!
